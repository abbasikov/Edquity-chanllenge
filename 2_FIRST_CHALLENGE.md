A student success manager (customer support) is having some trouble with the dashboard. They tell you that they clicked the pay button for `Kay Parsisson` and it didn't work. When the student success manager clicks the pay button for them it pays many more students than just them! ðŸ˜± Please fix the issue so that the student success manager can keep issuing payments confidently.
