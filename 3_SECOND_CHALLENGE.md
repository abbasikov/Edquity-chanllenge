# Second Challenge
That was a scary one. ðŸ˜… Disbursing emergency funds is the core of our business so it's very important to avoid any payment issues in the future.

Let's make sure this mistake doesn't happen again and write test(s) to ensure the Pay button is only available to people that should be eligible and that users can't be paid out funds if they don't have an application yet. Testing may not be the most glamorous, but it certainly beats the alternative of bug whack-a-mole and will help us not have to keep addressing this issue ever again.
