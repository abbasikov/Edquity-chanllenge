# Welcome to the Edquity coding challenge!

The first thing you should know is that it's totally okay if you don't finish. This challenge is intended to be used for a variety of different skill levels and as such, it's evaluated differently for each skill level. Let's quickly go over what to expect:

## Working on the challenge
2-3 hours is the maximum time frame that you should spend on this challenge. Please complete the challenges in order as it makes it easier to evaluate. There are 4 README files that go over each section of completion. When you are finished with each section, you can move on to the next readme file. Committing is strongly recommended at each checkpoint.

This exercise is intended to mirror a real life example as closely as possible without getting too nit-picky about production level tooling. Need stack overflow to look up regex, or to google a question about best practices? Totally fine! We all forget a little syntax here and there.

## Getting started
The repository is split into two parts, the UI and the API. The stack is React, Node/Express and mocks out a database that persists as long as the API is running. To get the app up and running is pretty straight forward:

1. Within each folder (`UI` and `API`) run `npm install`.
2. Once completed run `npm start` to start up each side of the app.
3. The API is available on `localhost:8080` and the web is available on `localhost:3000`
4. Upon file changes, the app should automatically reload.
5. "Resetting the database" is able to be done by simply restarting the API.

## Background
Edquity is an emergency aid disbursement application. We deal with students (users), applications for emergency aid, and payments out the students. You will encounter a mock dashboard the would be used by a customer success manager to approve payments to students.


## Submitting your work
Upon completion, please create a merge request to this repository with your name in the title. We will be automatically notified of open MR's and we will review it as soon as we can. Good luck!
